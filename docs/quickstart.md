Tutorials written in [Juptyer Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) are available to guide you through both accessing and 
using the data in the pacific-sound registry. A live preview of these notebooks can be found by clicking any of the links 
below, or by navigating through the menus by topic, e.g. Data Access, Blue Whales, etc.

These notebooks can be used in [SageMaker](/docs/installation/sagemaker.md), [Colab](/docs/installation/colab.md) or [on your computer](/docs/installation/local.md).

All audio files in this archive use the UTC time standard.
Start time is encoded in the file names and included in the metadata for each daily decimated file.

## Data Access and Decimation Notebooks

---

* [2kHz Data](notebooks/data/PacificSound2kHz.ipynb) ‚ú® Recommended first step to learn more about the low-frequency data
* [16kHz Data](notebooks/data/PacificSound16kHz.ipynb) ‚ú® Recommended first step to learn more about the low-mid-frequency data
* [256kHz Data](notebooks/data/PacificSound256kHz.ipynb) ‚ú® Recommended first step to learn more about the raw 10-minute data
* [256kHz to 2kHz Decimation](notebooks/data/PacificSound256kHzTo2kHzDecimate.ipynb) ‚ú® Recommended to learn about how the raw 10-minute data is decimated from 256kHz to 2Khz
